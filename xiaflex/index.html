                    <h1>A NONSURGICAL OPTION</h1>
                    <h2>Treatment with XIAFLEX®</h2>
                    <p>XIAFLEX® is an FDA-approved, nonsurgical treatment for adults with Dupuytren’s contracture (DC) when a cord can be felt. It starts working as soon as you receive the first injection.</p>
                    <p>XIAFLEX® is given:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a doctor’s office</li>
                        <li>By a hand specialist with training specifically for XIAFLEX®</li>
                        <li>With no general anesthesia required</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>DC rarely gets better on its own. </p>
                    <p>
                        <button class="btn btn-default">Find a trained hand specialist near you</button>
                    </p>
                    <p>XIAFLEX® should be administered by a hand specialist who is trained specifically for injection procedures on people with DC. XIAFLEX® can cause serious side effects such as tendon rupture or ligament damage.</p>
                    <h2>Ask your doctor if XIAFLEX® is right for you</h2>
                    <p>Your doctor may consider treatment with XIAFLEX® if you have:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contractures ranging from less serious to more severe</li>
                        <li>Multiple contractures in 1 hand. Up to 2 cords in 1 hand may be treated during 1 office visit</li>
                        <li>Contractures that have come back. DC may come back no matter what option you use. Nonsurgical XIAFLEX® is available if it returns</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <button class="btn btn-default">Download the Patient Brochure</button>
                    </p>
                    <h2>How XIAFLEX® works</h2>
                    <p>DC is caused by a buildup of collagen under the skin. The collagen may thicken and form a tight, rope-like cord.</p>
                    <p>XIAFLEX® is injected directly into the cord and works to break it down.</p>
                    <p>If you still have the cord, your doctor may try to extend the treated finger(s) to "break" the cord and try to straighten your finger(s).</p>
                    <h2>Demonstrated in clinical studies</h2>
                    <p>Studies show that prescription XIAFLEX®, along with a finger extension procedure, may help straighten or nearly straighten the affected finger and improve range of motion after up to 3 injections. </p>
